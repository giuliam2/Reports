    <p>Introduction 
The following report details the methodology and tools employed in a project aimed at creating a comprehensive story about the changing face of rock music beyond gender boundaries and throughout different time periods and regions. The primary data source for this project was Wikidata, a collaborative knowledge base that provided a wealth of information on artists, genres, and related entities within the rock music domain. Using the power of data and queries, this project wanted to analyze and present a story analysing the origin and development of rock music and highlighting the characteristics of two examples of rock bands. 

Methodology
The project began by collecting relevant data from Wikidata, which served as the basis of the research. Several SPARQL queries were created to extract information on rock music and its development, its artists, as well as their influence. The collected data were subjected to an in-depth exploration and analysis phase to identify noteworthy correlations and trends. The analysis helped to understand the evolution of rock music over time.
To create a compelling story, a narrative structure was developed to organise the collected data into a cohesive structure. The structure aimed to show the development of rock music over the years starting from the 1950s when it was born, continuing with the 10 most influential bands in the USA and highlighting the differences in gender (male and female) of two rock bands. </p>

      <p> Finally, an exposition of the different sub-genres of rock that developed between the years 1980 and 1985 is shown. Chronological and thematic approaches were used to present the story in an engaging and coherent manner.

Tools 
SPARQL Query Language SPARQL, a powerful query language for RDF (Resource Description Framework) data, was utilized to interact with the Wikidata. The queries were constructed to extract relevant data and filter the results based on specific criteria, such as time periods, genres, and artists. The flexibility and efficiency of SPARQL facilitated the extraction of large volumes of data from Wikidata. Data visualization played a crucial role in presenting the findings of the project. “MELODY” (MakE me a Linked Open Data storY) was employed to create tables, charts, graphs, and timelines. These visual representations enhanced the understanding of changes in rock music over time.

Challenges 
The project to create a history of the evolution of rock music using data from Wikidata presented several challenges. One of the main challenges was to ensure the consistency and completeness of the data obtained from Wikidata. Although Wikidata is a valuable resource, some entities may have limited or incomplete information. Some entities may have less data available, making it difficult to provide a complete analysis or narrative for these specific entities. The use of SPARQL queries to extract large volumes of data from Wikidata posed some challenges. Since the project aimed at analysing a large amount of information, it was crucial to optimise query performance and ensure efficient data retrieval.

Conclusion 
This report has outlined the methodology and tools employed in a project aimed at creating a story about the rock music using data from Wikidata. Through the careful collection, analysis, and organization of relevant information, a comprehensive narrative was constructed. The use of SPARQL queries and the data visualization tool MELODY proved invaluable in uncovering insights and creating an engaging story that captures the essence of rock music’s evolution. </p>

    <p>If you ever feel worried about whether you’ll find a seat for a last-minute concert, we have got you covered. In our nicely illustrated bar chart, you will be able to understand the capacity of UK’s theatres that shows the number of theatres that have a certain amount of seats from the one that can host the greatest audience to the tiniest ones. But to give you some more of the real data, an interesting table showing the inauguration year of the oldest theatres in the UK can be found. We personally advice you to check the iconic Globe Theatre out if you haven’t yet. Did you know that it was there that Shakespeare and his recital company used to act? Well, if you didn’t, do not worry, you can still go see some his most famous plays as they are on scene pretty much every week. Finally, moving towards the end of our recollection of information about theatres in the United Kingdom, you will encounter some names that might not instantly ring a bell to you, but they are actually some of the well-known composers from UK. As classical music is the most played genre in theatres, we thought one could also positively value some information about classical music composers who were born in the UK, and whose music was obviously played in UK theatres. If you’re starting to get more interested in classical music, you can visualize on our chart the main types of classical music with a nice description that explains them all. And of course, we couldn’t leave you without a nicely catalogue of classical compositions featuring influential figures of classical music such as Bach. Now, are you ready to explore?</p>
